= Accelerate tomcat 7/8 start-up

As it mentionned in this excellent article : https://wiki.apache.org/tomcat/HowTo/FasterStartUp, tomcat will be very faster to start-up if you add some parameter to the out-of-the-box version.

This table show How-To accomplished each case in Tomcat 7 or Tomcat 8 :

|===
| |Tomcat 7 |Tomcat 8 

|Disable scanning webapp
|web.xml
|web.xml

|Disable scanning web-fragment jar
|web.xml
|web.xml

|Excludes jars for scanning
|system properties only
|system properties or element in context

|Disable WebSocket support
|element in context
|element in context

|Disable JSP support
|not available
|element in context

|Reduce SecureRandom instance
|jvm option
|jvm option
|===

Now see some examples to each case

== Configure web.xml

=== Disable scanning the web application

Put metadata-complete attribute to web-app tag.

[source,xml]
====
<web-app *metadata-complete="true"*>

...

</web-app>
====


=== Disable scanning web-fragment jar

Add absolute-ordering tag

[source,xml]
====
<web-app>

*<absolute-ordering />*


</web-app>
====

== Configure context

There is 2 way to do this, regarding how the application is deployed :

* If the application is packaging with the classic way (WAR for example)
** this can be in META-INF/context.xml of the application
* If the application is deployed with Tomcat 7 VirtualWebApp concept or Tomcat 8 Resources mecanism (see link:https://tcollignon.github.io/2015/05/08/How-to-use-tomcat-8-Resources-to-setup-web-application.html[this article] for more explanations)
** this can be in server.xml file under the _<Host>_ who defined the application

=== Excludes jars for scanning

Add JarScanner tag

[source,xml]
====
<Context>

*<JarScanner>*

*<JarScanFilter defaultTldScan="false"/>*

*</JarScanner>*


</Context>
====

=== Disable WebSocket support

Put containerSciFilter attribute to Context tag

[source,xml]
====
<Context *containerSciFilter="org.apache.tomcat.websocket.server.WsSci"*>

...

</Context>
====


=== Disable JSP support (only tomcat 8)

Put containerSciFilter attribute to Context tag

[source,xml]
====
<Context *containerSciFilter="org.apache.jasper.servlet.JasperInitializer"*>

...

</Context>
====

== Configure JVM

=== Reduce SecureRandom instance to generate random

Set this option in the JVM who launch Tomcat (e.g. in _JAVA_OPTS_ or _CATALINA_OPTS_ environnment variable)

----
-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/./urandom
----

== Some performance tests examples

This tests are being executed on a simple web application with one REST service based on CXF and Spring.

This is not a real benchmark, it's just for illustrate each options.
