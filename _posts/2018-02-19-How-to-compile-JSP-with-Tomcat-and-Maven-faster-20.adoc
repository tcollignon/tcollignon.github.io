= How to compile JSP with Tomcat and Maven faster 2.0

I already write a blog post on this topic here : https://tcollignon.github.io/2016/12/04/How-to-compile-JSP-with-Tomcat-and-Maven-faster.html
Since this, I have proposed some PR to the project https://github.com/leonardehrenfried/jspc-maven-plugin, and now I'm an official commiter.
So I use this plugin in my work to compile many JSP each day, and I try to always compile faster.

== How to compile JSP

Like I said in my other blog post this is my actual Maven configuration : 

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
   <groupId>io.leonard.maven.plugins</groupId>
   <artifactId>jspc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>2.4.1</version>
   <configuration>
      <webAppSourceDirectory>${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}</webAppSourceDirectory>
      <webXml>${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-${project.version}/WEB-INF/web.xml</webXml>
      <generatedClasses>${project.build.directory}/jspc</generatedClasses>
   </configuration>
   <dependencies>
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.apache.tomcat</groupId>
         <artifactId>tomcat-jasper</artifactId>
         <version>8.5.4</version>
         <exclusions>
            <exclusion>
               <groupId>org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler</groupId>
               <artifactId>ecj</artifactId>
            </exclusion>
         </exclusions>
      </dependency>
      <dependency>
         <groupId>org.eclipse.jdt.core.compiler</groupId>
         <artifactId>ecj</artifactId>
         <version>4.6.1</version>
      </dependency>
   </dependencies>
</plugin>

Note : I override tomcat-jasper in this configuration in order to use version 8.5.4  (by default it's 8.5.8).

== Giving more threads

We have many jsp (> 500), so the compilation take time. We can increase numbers of parallel thread. Usually i five 4 threads, but for now I want to improve this.
So I test with 16 threads. *But surprise, the global time it's not better than 4*. Let's see what happen with jvisualvm : 

image::threadsSynchronizedJDTCompiler.PNG[]

We see there is many synchronization phase on each threads, this is not good for global performance.

== Try to fix synchronization

I want to avoid synchronization phase, so I look at the code. The main problem is the code who call _java.util.jar.jarFile_, and it's called by _sun.misc.URL.classPath.getResource(String)_
In the compiler the method who called that most of the time are _org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler$1.findType(String)_ and _org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler$1.isPackage(String)_
I try to rewrite part of it to totally avoid calling such a code, this is the case of _org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler$1.isPackage(String)_.
But some part of code can't be rewriting easylly, so I decided to add a synchronized hash map to add cache mecanism, this is the case of _org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler$1.findType(String)_.
With this 2 fix I improve synchronized parts, jvisualvm let me confirm that :

image::threadsSynchronizedParallelJDTCompiler.PNG[]

It's better ! We see that at the beggining there is a lot of syncrhonization, it's normal, it's time to put result in the cache, and then it use always the cache so there is no synchronization.
But if we inspect the diagram in the last part we see that theres is other synchronization. They are in the core of the compiler. I can't easily add a cache map to this part of code.
I think it's too much necessary time to fix this ... So I keep as is, it's still better than at the beggining.

=== Switch compiler class in Maven plugin

To use this improvment with Maven goal, I add a new option call "compilerClass" and I add a new Compiler in the plugin.
So by default compilerClass=org.apache.jasper.compiler.JDTCompiler, and it's work perfectly with 1 thread, but when we have more than 2 threads it preferable to use the new one "org.apache.jasper.compiler.ParallelJDTCompiler".
This PR have been merged in version 2.4.3 of the plugin : https://github.com/leonardehrenfried/jspc-maven-plugin/releases/tag/jspc-maven-plugin-2.4.3

=== Benchmark

I made a little benchmark with one project with ~3000 jsp.
I test this on HP ZBook i7 Windows 7.
